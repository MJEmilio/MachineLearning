# Machine Learning/Data Science Framework

![alt text](/img/test.png)


## Overview

This repository is meant to serve as a framework to build, train, deploy and improve Machine Learning Models based on statistics, probability theory, and linear algebra. This also serves as a learning tool to complement the theoretical materials of:
